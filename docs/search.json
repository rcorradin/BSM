Office hours are every Tuesday at 16:30.\n\n\n\nExam\nThe final exam consists of two parts, a project to be carried out in groups and an oral exam. The project focuses on the evaluation of the analysis and use of model skills acquired by the students, where they will be asked to produce a paper discussing the analysis of an applied problem using Bayesian techniques. The oral exam aims to verify the methodological skills acquired by the student.\n\n\n\nTextbooks and reading materials\nMain textbooks:\n\nGelman, A., Carlin, J. B., Stern, H. S., Dunson, D.
