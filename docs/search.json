Office hours are every Tuesday at 16:30.\n\n\n\nExam\nThe final exam consists of two parts, a project to be carried out in groups and a written exam. The project focuses on the evaluation of the analysis and use of model skills acquired by the students, where they will be asked to produce a paper discussing the analysis of an applied problem using Bayesian techniques. The written exam aims to verify the methodological skills acquired by the student and consists of 3 open questions. The use of texts or other materials is not permitted during the written exam. The final grade will be made up of a weighted average of the grades resulting from the project, 30% of the final grade, and from the written exam, 70% of the final grade.\n\n\n\nTextbooks and reading materials\nMain textbooks:\n\nGelman, A., Carlin, J.
